This dataset contains information on food choices, nutrition, preferences, childhood favorites, and other related details collected from college students. It includes a total of 126 responses.

Initially, the data was raw and uncleaned. I performed several data cleaning steps using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The cleaning process involved:

Handling missing values

Resolving inconsistent data

Removing duplicate entries

Encoding categorical (string/object) data into numerical format

Scaling and transforming the data

Detecting and handling outliers

These steps ensured that the dataset was well-prepared for analysis or modelling.
